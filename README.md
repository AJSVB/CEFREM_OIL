# CEFREM_OIL

Project introducing time patches for oil seep/spill distinction in a SAR data context.
All .ipynb files are usefull to understand the data, how it is extracted and processed.
script_nineth_attempt and script_tenth_attempt respectively correspond to the time approach and to the baseline approach.
Other scripts correspond to work not directly presented in the manuscript, but usefull to understand our work process. In particular, we first wanted to do segmentation, but simplified the feamework to perform a detection task, and finally a distinction task.
